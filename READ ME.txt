The CSS

Tags with classes such as content will be have a class of content-h (content home) and pages would be content-p (content-page). This includes header classes, button class etc. Universal classes will not have this style.

Some containers are custom made and are not the standard Bootstrap 4 container. To remove this container, just comment it out from the style.css (This is recommended for the purpose of the layout. Do not delete it.)

In the style.css, the styles are in sections with a “title” to easily understand, locate, and re-style without having to dig through the stylesheet. 

********

The Markup

Each section of the page will have a seperate container from the other sections making it easy to add or remove sections at will. The tages are placed to support the Bootstrap 4 framework.

Each section has a generic “title” to easily understand, locate, duplicate, or change without the hassle of a large unorganized markup.
